          <p>
            This is a review of metal Gear solid, the game that was originally
            released in 1998. It's been 26 years since this game came out and
            even right now I am enjoying this game tremendously. Feelings of
            nostalgia aside, I am having so much fun playing this game. The
            cinematography, the cutscenes, the depth of the story.... even the
            gameplay feels fresh in 2024. It is phenomenal and I enjoy it even
            more so because I'm older now and I can appreciate this game more.
            The depth of the story to understand it requires a certain type of
            maturity. Just to give you an idea of how long its been, when the
            game was first released I was 18 years old. That's how long ago this
            was. It almost feels like a different life time. Hideo Kojima the
            maker of this game is a genius. He and his vision was way, way ahead
            of its time. For some strange reason I don't know what it is, but
            I've played the sequels to this game some directed by him. all of
            them actually directed by him but it does not even come close to the
            sense of adventure and fun gameplay wise that I had with the first
            game the second game was great but it didn't invoke the same
            feelings as the first one.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case you have been living on a different planet or you weren't
            even born when this game first came out, this video game is about
            Solid Snake(it's just his name), a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear
            weapons facility to stop a terrorist threat from FOXHOUND(which is
            an evil special forces unit).Solid Snake must free the hostages and
            stop the terrorists from launching a nuclear strike.
          </p>

            The graphics and cinematography were way ahead of its time. The
            presentation was top notch. When other games that came out at the
            time the voice acting in the games were cheesy and sounded like a
            b-grade film. With this game, the voice acting was like something
            you would find in a blockbuster hollywood movie. In fact, the whole
            game feels like a AAA blockbuster film. The soundtrack, the
            background music score, the sound editing was arguably according to
            Hollywood standards. I remember feeling a lot of emotion that few
            movies could conjure up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gameplay included elements of stealth which debuted in the
            previous games in the series but were very limited in scope since
            everything was two dimensional in the previous games. The 3d games
            allowed for much more that could be done in this regard. As such a
            lot of games that came after it have tried to implement stealth
            mechanics with varying degrees of success. In addition to That there
            were rpg elements, you had to manage health, heal yourself etc etc.
            The game also included some of the most memorable boss fights I had
            encountered up to that time. Even today, the many different kinds of
            approaches you could take to pacify a boss were astonishing at that
            time. To conclude, this is one of if not my most favourite game of
            all time. For some reason, despite the advancement in graphics and
            sound technology, the overall experience for me, just doesn't get
            any better than this.
